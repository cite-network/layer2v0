# Graph Op Chain Documentation

Welcome to the Graph Op Chain documentation. This documentation covers the architecture, components, and flows of our L2 chain implementation.

## Documentation Structure

Our documentation is organized into different diagram categories to help you understand the system:

- **Architecture Diagrams**: System architecture and high-level design
- **Component Diagrams**: Detailed component interactions and structures
- **Flow Diagrams**: Data and process flows within the system
